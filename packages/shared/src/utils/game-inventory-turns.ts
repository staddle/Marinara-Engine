/**
 * Game Mode's inventory across the tellings of one turn.
 *
 * The stacks are one value per chat, but a turn can be told several times: regenerated, or swiped
 * back to an earlier telling. So the latest turn whose tags touched the stacks is remembered as
 * `gameInventoryTurn` in the chat's metadata: the stacks it began with, and what each telling left.
 * A new telling then starts from the turn's beginning, and switching tellings shows what that one
 * left, but only while the stacks are still exactly what the telling being left behind left them
 * as. Anything the player changed since is never thrown away: the new telling applies on top of it.
 * Pure: the server reads and writes the record.
